A version modified of Smallscreen theme, that took inspiration of the default xfce themes but with minimal decorations.

A dark, compact and minimalistic theme for XFCE desktop ( xfm4 windows-manager ).

- Compact header , 15px height !
- Flexible layout ( you can move button, title in Windows Manager Preferences )
- No colored frame on focus with selection color. 
- Button with dark grey dimed
- #d2d2d2 everywhere ; makes black of your content/picture deeper.

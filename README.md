A version modified of Smallscreen theme, that took inspiration of the default xfce themes but with minimal decorations, using mainly #333333 color for top bar and #666666 for controls.
This is a dark, compact and minimalistic theme for XFCE desktop ( xfm4 windows-manager ) compatible with the ![Numix Archblue theme](https://github.com/cryptomaniac512/AUR-numix-themes-archblue-git).

### Easy install :
``git clone https://github.com/Deevad/Darkcompact_xfwm4-theme.git``

- Compact header , 15px height !
- Flexible layout ( you can move button, title in Windows Manager Preferences )
- No colored frame on focus with selection color. 
- Button with dark grey dimed
- #333333 everywhere ; makes black of your content/picture deeper.
